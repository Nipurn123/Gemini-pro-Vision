## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed (version 3.x recommended)
- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) library for working with images (`pip install Pillow`)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) web framework (`pip install Flask`)
- Google Generative AI API Key - Get your API key from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual API key in `app.py`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-to-text-generator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd image-to-text-generator
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you are using the latest version of Python, you might need to use `pip3`:

   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   If you are using the latest version of Python, you might need to use `python3`:

   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```

5. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)
